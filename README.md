### Introduction: 

This is the Project of the Course Applied Cryptography of the Master in Cybersecurity at the University of Pisa. 

It is a simple Client-Server cloud storage application that is developed with security in mind. 

### Running

First: git-clone the entire codebase

#### Server: 

First lets start the server. 

1. Navigate to ../../Group5_Applied_Cryptography/src/server
2. type 'make' 
3. Launch server with ./serverPr  

The server is now running. Nothing more needs to be done 

#### Client 

Now lets launch the client. 

1. Navigate to ../../Group5_Applied_Cryptography/src/client
2. type 'make' 
3. Launch server with ./clientPr {registeredUsername} {portnumber} 
4. Type 'login'
5. Enter the chosen password

The client is now logged in.

registeredUsername = One of the usernames that is already present, as described in the project requirements 

#### Help
